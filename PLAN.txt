What do you want to make?

    I want to make a graphics pipeline that can render 3D meshes. It does not have to be efficient; it need only create a static 2D render.

What technology will you use?

    I will use C run on the CPU and the image format by NetPBM.

What features will it include?

    - Load in scene of meshes (models)
    - Apply linear transformations to meshes and to scene
        - Apply linear transformations to sets of objects around specified origin
    - Render to frame buffer via raycasting
    - Write frame buffer to generic image output

But what features must it include?

    - Write frame buffer to .ppm files

How will you implement it?

What's your timeline?
